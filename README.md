# BioFab24-E-Skin

**Abstract**: E-skin finds use in different devices and interfaces, as properties like flexibility and sensitivity are highly beneficial and applicable in various fields, such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), wearable electronics, and robotics. However, does e-skin often face challenges in terms of durability, self-healing capabilities and sustainability. Sustainable materials offer an alternative providing physical advantages in addressing these challenges. In this context, we therefore explore how the inherent characteristic of biomaterials, such as bacterial cellulose, can be utilized for the development of e-skin, as it has shown promising results in biohybrid devices and artifacts. We demonstrate the design and use of bacterial cellulose as e-skin by multilayer assembly, sensor development, and sensor integration into the material.

This project is a result of the "Bio-based Fabrication for Sustainable Interactive Systems" seminar at my university (Universit√§t des Saarlandes). I made this repository mainly to share the technology and information used to create the e-skin prototype. More on the work that was done can be found in the [report](https://github.com/clawdd/BioFab24-E-Skin/blob/main/SensitiveBacteria.pdf) , where we talk about growing, assembly, and evaluation.
