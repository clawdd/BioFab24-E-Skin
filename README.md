# BioFab24-E-Skin

**Abstract**: Due to its flexibility and sensitivity, E-skin is increasingly used in applications in fields such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), biomedical engineering, and robotics. However, current e-skin technologies face challenges related to durability, self-healing, and sustainability. Addressing these issues, sustainable materials offer promising alternatives with unique physical properties. In this context, we explore how the inherent characteristics of biomaterials, such as bacterial cellulose, can be utilized for the development of e-skin. We demonstrate the design and use of bacterial cellulose as an e-skin by multilayer assembly, sensor development, and sensor integration into the material.
